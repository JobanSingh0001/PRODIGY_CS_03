# Password Complexity Checker

# Overview

The *Password Complexity Checker* is a simple Python-based tool that assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Additionally, the tool checks if the password is common and provides suggestions for improving weak passwords.

# Features

- *Strength Evaluation**: The tool checks the password's strength based on:
  - Length (minimum 8 characters)
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()`)
  
- *Common Password Detection**: Identifies if the password is one of the commonly used weak passwords.

- *Feedback System**: Provides users with feedback on the password's strength (e.g., Very Strong, Strong, Medium, Weak, Very Weak).

- *Improvement Suggestions**: Suggests specific improvements to the password (e.g., adding uppercase letters or special characters).

# How It Works

1. *User Input*: The user enters a password they want to check.
2. *Criteria Check*: The tool checks the password against various strength criteria.
3. *Feedback & Suggestions*: The user receives feedback on their password’s strength and, if applicable, suggestions for improving it.

# Installation

1. *Clone the repository*:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-complexity-checker.git
   ```
   
2. *Navigate to the project directory*:
   ```bash
   cd password-complexity-checker
   ```

3. *Run the Python script*:
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system, and run the script:
   ```bash
   python password_checker.py
   ```

# Usage

1. Run the `password_checker.py` script.
2. Enter a password when prompted.
3. View the feedback on the password's strength and any suggestions for improvement.

Example:
```bash
Enter a password to check its strength: Password123!
Strong: Your password is good, but you could improve it.
Suggestions to improve your password: Use at least one special character.
```

# Password Strength Criteria

The password is evaluated on a score of 1 to 5:
- *5/5*: Very Strong
- *4/5*: Strong
- *3/5*: Medium
- *2/5*: Weak
- *1/5 or lower*: Very Weak

## Example Output

- *Very Strong*: Your password is secure!
- *Strong*: Your password is good, but you could improve it.
- *Medium*: Consider adding more variety to your password.
- *Weak*: Your password lacks complexity. Add more characters.
- *Very Weak*: Use a longer password with uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
